    <h1>Real life collaboration</h1>
    <p>
      Basically, I'd like to have something like the codewars.com, but where
      people can see each other's solutions and see different metrics of the
      solutions. So a group of people can collaborate, run tests and so on. The
      challenges should be more like real life challenges.
